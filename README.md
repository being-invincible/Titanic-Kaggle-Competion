# Titanic-Kaggle-Competion

On April 15, 1912, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. In this notebook, we carry an analysis to find out who these people are.

These are the steps we will be implementing on jupyter notebook.

1. ## **Data Loading**
2. ## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. ## **Data Preprocessing**
4. ## **Model Building in Tensorflow**
5. ## **Training the Model**
6. ## **Prediction**
